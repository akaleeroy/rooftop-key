## Summary

This is a printable key for access to the **[D Block](http://wikimapia.org/17751785/ro/Corpul-D)** rooftop terrace from **Entrance 3.** Climb up the stairs to the 4th floor, it's the door right next to apartment 42. If you ever forgot, you would be forgiven: [///smiling.roofs.forgiven](https://w3w.co/smiling.roofs.forgiven)

Because this is an old kind of key it can be hard to find a key copying center that can replicate it. That's why I made this repo.

## Print Settings

Tested with `PLA` filament at `100% infill`.
Requires some supports (for the bit, which is suspended).
